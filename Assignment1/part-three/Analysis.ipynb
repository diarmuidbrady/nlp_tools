    "## Analysis of Incorrect Predictions\n",
    "At the bottom there is a generated summary of 20 reviews, 5 misclassified positive reviews, 5 misclassified negative reviews, 5 correctly classified positive reviews and 5 correctly classified negative reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "The summaries look at the number of characters and words for each review along with the top 50 key words that have high probabilities but are also probabilistically biased toward the prediction outcome (if a review was predicted as 'positive', a word with P(word|positive) > P(word|negative) would be considered as a key word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nex three reviews are positive but have been classified as negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review 9\n",
    "The review contains words such as \"flaws\", \"holes\", and \"problems\", which may have caused the classifier to interpret it as negative.\n",
    "The review mentions that the film has \"enough holes to ruin the tale\", and that \"pivotal clue\" are \"obscure\". These criticisms may have contributed to the misclassification.\n",
    "The review mentions that \"the comparison between the two films is inevitable\", and that \"no doubt the original is better\". These phrases contains words like inevitable and doubt. This may have swayed the classifier to negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the summary below, we see that but, not, it's, like, out, up, just and no are some of negatively charged words that occur frequently in the review.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review 11\n",
    "Below are some examples of why the model may have classified the review as negative.\n",
    "- \"utterly useless\"\n",
    "- \"rather pointless\" - \n",
    "- \"stupid maybe but once i'm not disappointed\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to these several negative statements, the model may have gotten confused despite the overall positive theme.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review 15\n",
    "In review 15 there are several examples of negation being used. This would confuse the naive bayes model I develop because it does not handle negation instead it just uses a Bag of Words.\n",
    "- \"Despite its flaws, the film still manages entertaining.\" (the negation \"despite\" turns the negative \"flaws\" into a positive \"entertaining\").\n",
    "- \"While the plot may seem ridiculous, the cleverness of the script and the talent of the cast keep it alive.\" (the negation \"while\" turns the negative \"ridiculous\" into a positive \"cleverness of the script\" and \"talent of the cast\" keep it alive\".\n",
    "- \"The movie isn't likely to make a bundle like its predecessors, but that's what works.\" (the negation \"isn't\" turns the negative \"likely to make a bundle\" into a positive \"what works\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The following two reviews are negative but have been classified as positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review 167\n",
    "This review was predicted as positive despite it being an overall negative review. I was very confused by this review due to the fact that it is overwhelmingly negative. When looking at the key words we see\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"all-star cast\", \"beautiful teenage girl\", \"adventurous\" (all very positive language)\n",
    "- \"works more as bad laugh all melodrama\" (works and laugh here)\n",
    "- \"the most hilarious scene\", \"most laughable\" (even though they are negative comments, they use positive language)\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall however, this review was very negative. It is surprisingly to see it misclassified due to all the negative language used throughout such as \"innately disgusting\", \"non-thrilling action scenes\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review 178\n",
    "This review uses positive language such as \"lavish sets\" and \"fancy costumes\" as well as \"luscious cinematography\". These adjectives are very positive but are drowned out by the negative perspective on the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of a review that the naive bayes model will struggle with due to the positive language and complex use of phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis of Correct Predictions\n",
    "I have analysed 5 reviews, 3 that are positive and 3 that are negative. In each review, I point out details that may have influenced the model to make the correct decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review 0\n",
    "Based on the keywords given in the analysis, story and character appear to be positively associated words that are found often in this review. These words are not inherently good or bad but perhaps they are focused on in positive reviews.\n",
    "Below is a list of words that have positive connotations\n",
    "- magical\n",
    "- extremely good\n",
    "- memorable\n",
    "- spectacular\n",
    "- astonishing\n",
    "- successful\n",
    "\n",
    "Already there is a stark contrast between correctly and incorrectly classified reviews. The language is much more clear and decisive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review 1\n",
    "Review 1 is a little hit and miss. It has overall positive sentiment but some of the language used is sometimes uncertain. \n",
    "- \"very good special effects\" (good and special are clear positive words)\n",
    "- \"never fails\" (a negation on fails using never, this is a phrase that may confuse the model)\n",
    "- \"fair bit of action particularly towards end\" (here is an example of uncertain language with positive sentiment)\n",
    "- \"definitely watchable\" (this is a strange expression, definitely has such certainty while watchable indicates a level of mediocrity)\n",
    "\n",
    "I think overall Review 1 leans strongly on the side of positive. It makes sense the model correctly classified considering the number of positive phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review 2\n",
    "Review 2 is a mixed review. There is a lot of language that is both positive and negative. Here is some of the positive language:\n",
    "- \"magnificent bombast of mr downey jr's performance\" (magnificent and bombast are powerfully positive)\n",
    "- \"captivatingly dynamic blusterous stealthy piece work\" (this expression is quite mixed, often blusterous is negative but has a positive leaning in this context)\n",
    "- \"never less than wildly entertaining and insightful\" (never and less may confuse the model but entertaining and insightful may push to the positive side)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of negative comments include:\n",
    "- \"several sequences fall flat\" (fall flat is a phrase that won't be recognised by the model but it may place negative sentiment on the word 'flat')\n",
    "- \"unconvincing fashion\", \"uncompelling weepy finale\" (unconvincing and uncompelling are undesirable)\n",
    "- \"film's thematic narrative rather dubious\" (there is a contrast between thematic and dubious that our model may not understand, instead thematic and dubious may cancel one another out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall this review is positive but it was challenging for the model to discern between the mixed comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are two example negative reviews correctly classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review 195\n",
    "This is review is the most negative I have seen in the dataset. It is strongly deflamatory toward the movie and uses a variety of negative words and phrases that negatively sway the model toward classifying the review correcly.\n",
    "- \"clearly worst\" (definitive language)\n",
    "- \"wasn't anything i'd lose sleep over\" (an example of negation)\n",
    "- \"mtv-influenced tripe\" (strongly negative word use however mtv-influenced may not be common in the corpus)\n",
    "\n",
    "The positive language used in this review was negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This review is an example of where the naive bayes model works very effectively, the language is clear (bar some a few examples mentioned) and there is little nuance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review 196\n",
    "Review 196 is very negative but it does contain language that may be positive but is used in a negative context.\n",
    "- \"bizarre enjoyment quality all its own\" - enjoyment is typically positive, but it's just lauging about the film's failures.\n",
    "- \"slick modern masterpiece Deliverance\" - masterpiece is positive, but it's not talking about this film\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this the model make the right decision. This is because of the volume of other negative language used throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Comments and Conclusion\n",
    "As a whole the Naive Bayes Sentiment Classifier achieved 84.50% accuracy which is impressive. We see there are places that it works well and others that it does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the performance of naive bayes classifier depends on several factors, including the data (is it definitive or ambiguous), the vocabulary and the amount of training data (are there enough examples for reliable probabilities). While this model can work well in some cases, it may make mistakes when the sentiment is not solely determined by individual words or when there are many rare or ambiguous words that can cause confusion."

      "if anything stigmata should taken warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close one another four supernatural horror flicks released year clearly worst suppose should have seen coming after all blair witch thoroughly creeped out sixth sense was mildly spooky then stir echoes had its moments but wasn't anything i'd lose sleep over clearly quality horror summer has slowly been dropping then any surprise stigmata dullest most horribly executed piece mtv-influenced tripe have seen long while no not really patricia arquette plays frankie page hairdresser from pittsburgh receives rosary gift from globe-trotting mother turns out rosary belonged recently-deceased brazilian priest priest's church had been under investigation father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne because mysterious appearance bleeding statue father kiernan investigator has made career out disproving supposed religious signs but time believes something bleeding statue investigation soon called off however frankie starts exhibiting signs stigmata person inflicted wounds like jesus christ father kiernan initially skeptical frankie' s story considering she's atheist but once witnesses stigmata attacks himself dedicates himself finding out going eventually begins suspect boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce concealing something could bring down catholic church turns out dead priest had been working translation fifth gospel before were excommunicated new rupert wainwright music video mean stigmata sort starts off ok only gets worse indeed would have been good if were music video because it's only interesting five minutes i'm not sure wainwright trying prove endless parade slow-motion double-exposure extreme close-ups whoaaaaaa other than fact has most swelled head any director hollywood yes has been school camera trickery interesting little while but eventually becomes headache-inducing needed second audio track played over dialogue such wainwright screaming audience see look can do i'm ex-cellent dir-ect-or maybe then he'd explain why decided start half scenes slow-motion shots water dripping reverse why included random superfluous shots egg frying ooh scary if was some underlying meaning behind all camera trickery didn't see just thought was safe get involved story here comes double-exposure shot two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed no reason whatsoever arrrrrrrghhhh then again superfluous camera trickery wouldn't bother if stigmata had story characters were remotely engaging though wainwright's vanity certainly doesn't help does seem have been given nearly unworkable script plot continuity character development need case point frankie page character assume we supposed identify sympathize but we aren't given any back story character any reason like extent character development seems hard-working hairdresser can somehow afford cavernous apartment top floor building she's kind cute let's start bleeding fact she's clearly not brightest bulb drawer doesn't help either according frankie page first thing do after receiving mysterious wounds your wrists back go clubbing sure makes sense arquette byrne pryce give old college try but their characters one-dimensional just appear sleepwalking scenes between arquette byrne were probably supposed sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat because setup romantic subplot clumsily handled almost reaches point becoming laughable even though frankie page's life falling apart before very eyes still finds time hit priest wanders hair salon even more curiously seems interested advances father andrew's religious doubt pops up suddenly seems more silly than dramatic pryce may well wear curled mustache cackle i'll get my pretty all depth cardinal houseman afforded trust i'm not revealing anything telling pryce turns out villain what's worse after being faced dull characters prospect having annoying camera tricks loud music jammed down our throats we now have contend story starts off one direction veers off another then another ends up being totally incomprehensible first all doesn't even bother explain should very simple plot details how does frankie get stigmata merely touching rosary how come atheist like was chosen since father andrew mentions only very devout believers have ever received stigmata actually i'm not sure frankie was posessed supposedly stigmata occurs one posessed holy spirit but later has being posessed dead priest later some evil spirit think one answer question course very simple possessing entity each scene determined whichever effects flashy camera work mr wainwright wants use time furthermore ending ridiculously neat little wrap-up filmmakers compound problem ultimately turning into diatribe against catholic church if do any research all gospel st thomas you'll find not being suppressed church seems claim but readily available your local library there's nothing catholics need worry though stigmata's religion off-base can't confused anything remotely resembling real catholic church if wanted portray catholic priests mobsters should have gone all-out equipped sharkskin suits tommy guns would have been far more interesting i'm not catholic fact don 't care much catholic church but its cartoonish misrepresentation should not considered realistic any means it's rare see fails many levels stigmata does it' s not thought-provoking though would like definitely not scary though pretends i'm not sure why tried pass off horror because absolutely nothing scary story maybe it's attempt cover up fact none scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever initial shock seeing arquette covered blood dulled fact happens over over over like many films mtv generation one suffers from overkill much overdone stigmata eventually has no effect audience leaving us pick out film's many flaws i'm also still trying figure out why quotation take from gospel st thomas earth-shattering we finally hear saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns their first day sunday school means all its flash whole really much ado nothing dog days summer usually produce one monstrous dog stigmata\n",
