# Naive Bayes Sentiment Classifier Guide
In this directory open up a terminal and run `python run_part_three.py`. This will walk you through part 3. You will be able to train the model on 'train.pkl' and test the model on 'test.pkl'. If you have your own reviews without labels in a text file, one per line, you can enter the file name (put it in the same directory) and predict the values. For both tasks you can inspect the variables of the model after prediction.

The analysis can be viewed in the Analysis.html file.
