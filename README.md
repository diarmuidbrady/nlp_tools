# CA4023 Natural Language Technologies Assignments
- This repository is dedicated to the module CA4023 Natural Language Technologies assignments.
- These assignments tested the skills and content I learned in the course. I attained a 76% in the module.
- The assignment code and all relevant information can be found in the `Assignment 1` and `Assignment 2` directories.
- A python library containing all the modules from `Assignment 1` along with full documentation and unit testing can be found in the `nbs` and `nlp` directories, and the *Index.ipynb* Jupyter Notebook.
- Further details below.

## Key Insights and Highlights
- Developed an NLP python library to assist text processing that has full documentation and unit testing of code.
- Optimized a logistic regression algorithm using negation handling to improve sentiment analysis.
- Implemented text summarization on top of the BERT model to handle long movie reviews for sentiment analysis.
- Performed a critical analysis of the capabilities of ChatGPT by asking it to discuss how a film score can support the underlying themes and the key moments of a characters arc in a film.

## NLP Python Library
- The python library is written using a nbdev framework.
- The original notebooks can be found in the `nbs` directory.
- The auto-generated python `.py` modules can be found in the `nlp` directory, this is an importable library.
- The documentation for each function in the library can be viewed in `Index.ipynb`.

## Assignment 1
- Consists of three parts, each for a separate task.
  - Sentence Splitter
  - Bigram Model
  - Naive Bayes Sentiment Classifier
- Inside each subdirectory, there is a README explaining what to do, a python file, containing the source code, and another python file to run the exercise.

## Assignment 2
- Consists of three parts, each for a separate task.
  - Optimized logistic regression algorithm using negation handling for sentiment analysis.
  - Implemented text summarization on top of the BERT model to handle long movie reviews for sentiment analysis.
  - Performed a critical analysis of ChatGPT capabilities.
